# Tidy Tuesday

A place to host submissions for the weekly social data project in R - [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). It's hosted by the fantastic R4DS community.

I take part in Tidy Tuesday intermittently, but when I do I aim to share my code and write a [blog post](http://trianglegirl.rbind.io/#posts).
